# The apis.is scraper

Hi!

If you're here it's probably because you've found a link to this document
in your web server logs. This due to our scraping of your data periodically
to be able to serve those back up to people in a machine-consumable format
so that they can build really [cool projects](./built-with-apis.md) with
that data.

If this is something you think we really shouldn't be doing, feel free to
open up a [issue](https://github.com/apis-is/apis/issues/new) and we'll try
to see if we can come to a conclusion that would make everyone happy :)
